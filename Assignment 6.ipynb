    "# Question 1: \n",
    "Define Object Oriented Programming Language? \n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming Language refers to a type of computer programming in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations that can be applied to the data structure. It help to reduce the complexity and also improve the maintainability of the system. When combined with the concepts of the Encapsulation and Polymorphism, Abstraction gives more power to the OPP languages."

    "List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it goot for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden. Objects can also be reused within an across apllications. The resue of software also lowers the cost of development."

    "Answer:\n",
    "A function is a piece of code that is called by name. A method is piece3 of code that is called by a anme that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences. Amethod is implicitly passed the object on which it was called."

    "    1. Class\n",
    "         Class is a blueprint of an object. The class defines all the common properties of the different objects that belong to it.\n",

    "         An Attribute is a named property of a class. It has a type. It describe the range of values that property may hold. Attribe may be Name, Location, Datys Offered and Credit Hours.\n",
